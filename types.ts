// This file can be used for shared TypeScript types and interfaces across the application.
// For example:
// export interface Agent {
//   id: string;
//   name: string;
//   description: string;
//   code: string;
// }

// Currently, no complex shared types are needed that aren't better co-located or simple enough for inline definition.
